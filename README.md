# Kaiburr_Task-1
Java backend and REST API example

The repository includes screenshots demonstrating API functionality. ðŸš€
Inside the folder: Task 1/Screenshots

Source code: Task 1/task-manager/src/main/java/com/example/task_manager

Tech Stack:
  -Java 21
  -Spring Boot
  -Maven
  -MangoDB
  -Postman (for Testing)

âœ… REST API Endpoints:

--GET /tasks â†’ Retrieve all tasks or a specific task by ID.

--POST or PUT /tasks â†’ Create or update a task.

--DELETE /tasks/{id} â†’ Delete a task by ID.

--GET /tasks/find?name=xyz â†’ Search tasks by name.

--PUT /tasks/{id}/execute â†’ Run the task's shell command in the terminal and store execution details.

âœ… Task Execution Management:

Each task has an ID, name, owner, command, and execution history.

When a task runs, a new TaskExecution entry is recorded with start time, end time, and output.

âœ… MongoDB Integration:

Tasks and their executions are stored in MongoDB.

Uses Spring Data MongoDB for database operations.

âœ… Security and Validation:

Application validates the command provided in the request - if the command contain unsafe/malicious code, it will return { error: Unsafe Command Detected}

This backend is tested using Postman
